# Deploying Your Mental Health Assessment Platform on Render

This guide will walk you through deploying your mental health assessment platform on Render, a reliable and free hosting service that's perfect for Flask applications.

## Step 1: Create a Render Account

1. Go to [render.com](https://render.com/)
2. Click "Sign Up" in the top right corner
3. You can sign up with GitHub, Google, or email
4. Complete the registration process

## Step 2: Prepare Your Application Files

1. Download all the files I've provided:
   - main.py
   - requirements.txt
   - All template and static files

2. Create a GitHub repository (optional but recommended):
   - Go to [github.com](https://github.com)
   - Sign up or log in
   - Click the "+" icon in the top right and select "New repository"
   - Name your repository (e.g., "mental-health-platform")
   - Make it "Public"
   - Click "Create repository"
   - Follow the instructions to upload your files

## Step 3: Deploy on Render

1. Log in to your Render dashboard
2. Click "New +" and select "Web Service"
3. Connect your GitHub repository or use the "Upload Files" option
4. Configure your web service:
   - Name: mental-health-platform (or any name you prefer)
   - Environment: Python
   - Build Command: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
   - Start Command: `gunicorn src.main:app`
   - Select the Free plan

5. Click "Create Web Service"

## Step 4: Configure Environment Variables

1. In your Render dashboard, go to your web service
2. Click on the "Environment" tab
3. Add the following environment variables:
   - Key: `PYTHON_VERSION`, Value: `3.9.0` (or your preferred Python version)
   - Key: `PORT`, Value: `10000`

4. Click "Save Changes"

## Step 5: Access Your Deployed Application

1. Wait for the deployment to complete (this may take a few minutes)
2. Once deployed, Render will provide you with a URL (e.g., https://mental-health-platform.onrender.com)
3. Click on this URL to access your application

## Step 6: Test Your Application

1. Visit the URL provided by Render
2. Test the provider setup flow
3. Test the assessment selection and administration
4. Test the QR code generation
5. Test the bilingual support

## Step 7: Share Your Application

1. Share the URL with your junior colleagues
2. They can access it directly or via the QR code generated by the platform

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues:

1. Check the logs in your Render dashboard
2. Make sure all files are correctly uploaded
3. Verify that the requirements.txt file includes all necessary dependencies
4. Ensure the start command correctly points to your application

## Alternative Hosting Options

If Render doesn't work for your needs, here are some alternatives:

1. **Heroku** - Similar to Render but requires a credit card for verification
2. **PythonAnywhere** - Specifically designed for Python applications
3. **Vercel** - Good for static sites and serverless functions

Each of these platforms has a free tier suitable for your application.
